abstract: '<p><strong>Smart Cloth Based on Wearable Device for Health Monitoring with
  IoT Connectivity.</strong></p>

  <p>The advancement of wearable device technologies has revolutionized healthcare,
  paving the way for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. This research
  focuses on the development of continuous health monitoring wearable devices that
  operate wirelessly, enabling seamless monitoring of biological parameters. The integration
  of IoT connectivity allows for the real-time hosting of biological data on a dedicated
  Node.js server, ensuring that authorized personnel or organizations can access and
  monitor health information remotely with the necessary permissions. Our device is
  designed to function in both online and offline modes, with an additional feature
  of a GSM module for alerting responsible personnel through SMS and voice calls.
  The system is engineered for low power consumption, making it ideal for integration
  into smart clothing, which enhances user comfort while providing continuous health
  monitoring.</p>

  <p>Our server infrastructure is built to continuously monitor and analyze biological
  data collected from the smart cloth, ensuring room-based connectivity that facilitates
  interaction between users and healthcare workers. The real-time chat service integrated
  into our platform promotes efficient communication and data analysis. Raw biological
  data collected through the smart cloth is stored in an SQL database, where it undergoes
  processing for report generation and drug scheduling services. The smart cloth,
  with an average accuracy of 91%, demonstrates high performance across its sensors,
  with data acquisition accuracy ranging from 80% to 95%. This high level of accuracy
  ensures reliable monitoring and reporting, thereby automating critical healthcare
  tasks and reducing the burden on healthcare personnel.</p>

  <p>The primary objective of this project is to enhance healthcare delivery by automating
  critical monitoring and reporting tasks, thereby decreasing the manpower required
  in hospital settings. By leveraging advanced IoT and GSM technologies, our wearable
  device not only ensures continuous and accurate health monitoring but also facilitates
  timely interventions through automated alerts and comprehensive data analysis. This
  innovative approach promises to improve patient outcomes by providing real-time
  health insights and fostering a more responsive healthcare environment. Our smart
  wearable system represents a significant step forward in the integration of technology
  and healthcare, offering a practical solution to modern healthcare challenges.</p>
