This research focuses on the development of continuous health monitoring wearable devices that operate wirelessly, enabling seamless monitoring of biological parameters. The integration of IoT connectivity allows for the real-time hosting of biological data on a dedicated Node.js server, ensuring that authorized personnel or organizations can access and monitor health information remotely with the necessary permissions. Our device is designed to function in both online and offline modes, with an additional feature of a GSM module for alerting responsible personnel through SMS and voice calls. The system is engineered for low power consumption, making it ideal for integration into smart clothing, which enhances user comfort while providing continuous health monitoring.

Our server infrastructure is built to continuously monitor and analyze biological data collected from the smart cloth, ensuring room-based connectivity that facilitates interaction between users and healthcare workers. The real-time chat service integrated into our platform promotes efficient communication and data analysis. Raw biological data collected through the smart cloth is stored in an SQL database, where it undergoes processing for report generation and drug scheduling services. The smart cloth, with an average accuracy of 91%, demonstrates high performance across its sensors, with data acquisition accuracy ranging from 80% to 95%. This high level of accuracy ensures reliable monitoring and reporting, thereby automating critical healthcare tasks and reducing the burden on healthcare personnel.

The primary objective of this project is to enhance healthcare delivery by automating critical monitoring and reporting tasks, thereby decreasing the manpower required in hospital settings. By leveraging advanced IoT and GSM technologies, our wearable device not only ensures continuous and accurate health monitoring but also facilitates timely interventions through automated alerts and comprehensive data analysis. This innovative approach promises to improve patient outcomes by providing real-time health insights and fostering a more responsive healthcare environment. Our smart wearable system represents a significant step forward in the integration of technology and healthcare, offering a practical solution to modern healthcare challenges.
